GIT ON THE SERVER

  In order to initially set up any Git server, you have to export an existing repository into a new bare repository – a repository that doesn’t contain a working directory.  In order to clone your repository to create a new bare repository, you run the clone command with the --bare option. By convention, bare repository directories end in .git
    
      $ git clone --bare myfirstproject myfirstproject.git
                      
                      OR
  Rename the whoel directory structure.
  
      $ cp -Rf myfirstproject myfirstproject.git
      
      
      
NOW PUT BARE REPOSITORY IN SERVER      
    
    To put the bare repository user scp protocol to move to server .
    
    $scp -r myfirstproject.git username@yourgitserver.come:/path/to/git/location/
